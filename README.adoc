boodle uses these Clojure/ClojureScript libraries:

* https://github.com/juxt/aero[aero]
* https://github.com/juxt/bidi[bidi]
* https://github.com/weavejester/compojure[compojure]
* https://github.com/jkk/honeysql[honeysql]

* https://github.com/Day8/re-frame[re-frame]
* https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[ring]
* https://github.com/tonsky/tongue[tongue]

I used https://bulma.io/[Bulma] for the UI, and I customised
https://github.com/benhowell/re-frame-modal[re-frame-modal] and
https://github.com/timgilbert/cljs-pikaday[cljs-pikaday] to play well with it.
Check the
https://github.com/manuel-uberti/boodle/blob/master/doc/index.adoc[documentation]
for more details.

== Usage

=== Prerequisites

To run boodle, you need:

* a Java JDK/JRE suitable for your system (I use
https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK])
* https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure]
* https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL]
* https://yarnpkg.com/en/[yarn]
* https://gulpjs.com/[gulp]
* http://shadow-cljs.org/[shadow-cljs]

=== Database setup

Set up the database with the necessary tables and permissions you find in
https://github.com/manuel-uberti/boodle/blob/master/resources/sql/model.sql[model.sql].
Check also `resources/config/config.edn` to adjust the database connection
parameters.

=== Compiling

From the project root, run:

[source,console]
----
$ yarn
$ cd resources/src
$ gulp
----

Compile the ClojureScript files with:

[source,console]
----
$ shadow-cljs compile boodle
----

=== Running

From the project root, fire up the server with:

[source,console]
----
$ clj -A:run
----

You can now browse at `+http://localhost:8080+` and interact with boodle.

=== Docker and Docker Compose

Thanks to https://github.com/moqmar[Moritz Marquardt], you can also run boodle
via https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Docker] and
https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/[Docker Compose]:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/manuel-uberti/boodle.git && cd boodle
$ docker-compose up -d
----

You can now access boodle at `+http://localhost:8080+`.

== Tests

Unit tests are configured with https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha]
and can be run from the project root with:

[source,console]
----
$ ./bin/kaocha
----

== Linting

I use [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo) to check my code. Refer
to its README if you want to know more.

== Extra

The included `etc/boodle.service` is a basic
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html[systemd unit]
that executes `etc/deploy.sh` to update, build and run boodle automatically on
my home server.
